This is the landing page for the Approximated Weather simulation, Forecasting and Automated Warning System.

This program will feature a 3D-gridded approximated weather simulation akin to the idea of a weather-in-a-box, but the box is seamless. The forecasting and automated warning systems are extensions that will interface with the simulation.
